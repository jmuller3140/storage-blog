# Storage-as-a-Service

## The Current Analysis
Storage as a service is an amazing best business. It is as close to SaaS as you can get without actually being a software company.

As any PE person many tell you, the mark of a good SaaS company that COGs are essentially zero at scale and the profit margins are 20%. Unfortunatly, being a "real world service" ensures there are in fact real COGs but in regards to reoccuring revenue and demand stability, storage is good as you can get.

The main benefit of storage is the fact that the demand is evergreen. It can be traced back as far as ancient Rome when climate controlled storehouses were built to store grain. And the beauty of NYC is that there is never enough space. The human desire for more space is built into the DNA of the city -- in fact it is a primary trait. You can't really call yourself a New Yorker unless you shared an apartment with 3 other strangers living in a 1200 sq ft apartment.

Human excess will always be a thing, and with consumer debt at an all time high, unless people will have a come to Jesus moment and start selling their their belongings, the demand for storage will always be there. Especially when people downsize and move to smaller spaces.

## The Opportunity
If you look up storage facilties in NYC, you will find a plethora of them. The main business mode of self storage is a simple rent arbitrage. According to the site Storagense, self-storage profit margins can be as high as 41% and "Reports show that an impressive 38% of Americans have rented a self storage unit or planned to do so in the future."

You don't need to be good at math to figure out that as long as you have enough to pay your debt premiums your good to go. The business rolls over year over year and if some decides to not pay up, you own their goods as collatoral. Storage is as SaaS-y as a business as it comes, with added benefits. 

## The Future
As mentioned in a prior post here [AI and Work](/blog/ai-and-work), AI is slowly eating the software engineering labor market and the typical SaaS business model is becoming more and more commoditized. The benefit of commoditized software is that it is easy to build and easy to scale, and the industries that are historically non-tech business will see better quality services and more efficient operations that were either outside of the domain of the industry or too costly to implement due to the premium of good software engineering.

If you lookup any storage company website you will still see that their landing pages look like they were built in the 90s -- there is no direct price transparency, and plastered on every site is have a phone number and a quote form. You have to call them, they give you a quote, rent space denominated in square feet, and then you have to schedule a time to pick up your stuff.

People live with it because Storage as a service is high intent. If you need storage, you need it now and you will live with the brief inconveniences scheduling the services of a storage company.

## The Opportunity
Anyone that has been in NYC may remember a company called MakeSpace. MakeSpace was a storage company that was a bit more modern than the rest. Their main advantage was not only modern branding but a phone application that allowed you to get a quote and schedule a pickup from your phone. Access to the storage facility was also via a phone app and which a customer could coordinat pickups and dropoffs. They had an internal labeling service and an app to track your goods, all with picture identification. There were some reviews that the company was not the best at handling your goods, but they were a bit more modern than the rest. AFAIK they eventually got acquired by Clutter due to being unable to raise capital and were running default dead. The company is now defunct. Most people may look at this as justification of why it couldn't work but I simple think it was a sterotypical case of overspend and raising too much capital.

The mission here, in a post AI world, is just to make a MakeSpace 2.0. more cheaply and reduce the overhead of the business. If you can modernize the storage business and create a faster, and cheaper storage service in a dinosaur industry, I think it's a no brainer. The beauty is storage may not be a sexy business, but it is a stable one. Being able to achieve a cash flow generating monster of (at minimum) a couple millions of dollars of profit but being able to count on it for a lifetime is pretty great.

I'm just an indie hacker, and professional software engineer but I think the opportunity to build a modern storage company with the 10x productivity gains of the modern tech stack is as safe of a bet as they come. I'm confident I can replicate the internal application services of the ole' MakesSpace and some.

We will also take way better care of your goods.

Let's see if it can be done.

More on my plans for the execution later.
