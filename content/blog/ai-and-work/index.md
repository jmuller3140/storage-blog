## The Diagnosis
SaaS (software as a service), the categorical Silicon Valley darling is about to go through a giant upheaval. It is already happening. Dev jobs are either being offshored or companies are hiring via contract only and the glory days of getting paid 6 figs for an overpaid CRUD engineering gig will be a thing of the past in a couple years. Salesforce decided to notoriously decided to not hire any Software Engineers this year. See article [here](https://www.salesforceben.com/salesforce-will-hire-no-more-software-engineers-in-2025-says-marc-benioff/).

Companies are now starting to realize their only real moat was sales connections or tech execution. Tech famously does not have an IP regulatory regime that prevents companies from copying functionality or features which is causing both breakneck innovation but now due to AI, this is causing labor commoditization. 

And the commoditzation will seemingly continue.

Even PG is getting blown away.

## The Decline
Unfortunatley there is no sign of this slowing down. If you check out this FRED graph here it shows the number of software development job postings on Indeed -- presumably with the blow up due to the pandemic, but now the numbers are below pre-pandemic levels.

I see this as a mark of not only software engineering becoming more commoditized, but the tech sector as a whole.

It may get worse, and the bar for software engineering in order to maintain employement will be higher, but it is very clear if you want to continue working in tech lucratively, you need to start building or else your current job will slowly become a relic of the past. Like using morse code to send a message instead of a text -- sure you can write code the bespoke specialized way, but why can't I just prompt my features into existence instead?

The issue is in 2025 if you want to start a (tech) company, you need to have a predictable amount of staying power. AI has flipped execution moats on it's head. At once point there was a meme floating around that every time OpenAI did a product release, it would wipe out an entire batch of YC companies. Now that the FAANGs of the world are also all in building AI tooling, it is even more difficult to build an execution moat that can predictably guarantee your SaaS startup will have PMF or pricing power in 2 years.

Of course there will be new winners in the space of AI and tooling, but it is becoming more and more difficult to predict what will be the next big thing. Even if there's a viable idea that works out, it will take signficantly less time to commoditize that idea and destroy the pricing power of said company. 

The kicker here is software is still integral to every business going forward but the only pure software businesses that have staying power will be ones with network effects -- the traditional SaaS model will and is being commoditized.


## Bright Spots
Despite the nature of AI on the workplace, it has never been better to start building in spaces that traditionally has never been able to easily be reached by software -- non-SaaS companies. Frankly, I think most of the talented people in the world for the past 20 years were software guys and it was hard to have the incentive to innovate outside of the world of bits. Now in 2025, hardware innovation and real world services are about to see the anceillary gains from AI because software development and labor costs are going to continue to drop.

If you're not building rocketsships to Mars, robot butlers, VR, military equipment, drones, autonomous vehicles, or anything else that is not manifesting outside the screen of the computer, it will be a pretty big uphill battle to get your company to scale and to have staying power. 

This has led me to take a pretty low hanging fruit idea and see if I can get it to work -- a physical storage business (more on this later).
