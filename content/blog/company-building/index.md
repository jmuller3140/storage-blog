## Balancing Capital Needs with SaaS Innovation

One of the significant challenges in the storage industry is the requirement for substantial upfront capital. This capital is essential to acquire and maintain physical storage facilities, vehicles for transportation, and the necessary infrastructure to support operations. Traditionally, this capital is sourced through debt or other financial vehicles, which can impose a heavy financial burden on a new business.

In previous years, with lower interest rates, it was easier to start businesses with higher capital requirements due to the cheap cost of capital. Companies like WeWork were able to leverage this environment to scale rapidly. However, as interest rates rise, the cost of borrowing increases, making it more challenging to sustain such capital-intensive models. This shift underscores the importance of bootstrapping and focusing on capital efficiency wherever possible.

In contrast, a Software as a Service (SaaS) product offers a distinct advantage: it requires minimal overhead to start. SaaS businesses can be launched with relatively low initial investment, focusing on software development and cloud infrastructure rather than physical assets.

To offset the capital-intensive nature of the storage business, we plan to develop SaaS applications that are crucial for internal automation in areas such as sales, marketing, and customer experience (CX). These applications will be integrated into the daily operations of Boring Storage, enhancing efficiency and productivity. By automating processes like lead scoring, marketing distribution, and real-time inventory updates, we can streamline operations and reduce manual overhead. With the power of AI agents, we should be able to streamline operations in a new way, enabling more intelligent decision-making and predictive analytics to further optimize our business processes.

Moreover, these SaaS solutions (the ones that are generic enough) will be released to the public, allowing other businesses to benefit from our innovations. By offering these tools as a SaaS application, we can generate additional revenue streams while maintaining competitive pricing compared to incumbents and new startups - as they are not our primary focus. This pricing strategy allows us to offer high-quality tools at a lower cost, providing a competitive edge in the market. The revenue generated from these applications will be leveraged to support and expand the storage company, reducing reliance on external capital sources.

Besides generating upfront revenue, this model is beneficial for a couple reasons:

1. Our primary customer in building software is for our own business. This gives us a start in regards to finding PMF because we solve our own problems first. We don't need to do discovery if we are building for ourselves. We hope this applies to others as well, but it's not the end goal if it doesn't. However, most of the best startups were built by people who were solving their own problems first.

2. When SaaS companies experience profit declines, there is an existential crisis. They scale up due to the overnight influx of quick capital, but now just as quickly against the backdrop of AI their competitive advantage could be gone overnight, and they have to go through the painful process of scaling down. Because our north star is to grow the storage business, it will (hopefully) keep us honest and focused on the long term, focusing on key features and ignoring the rest. This will keep us lean and continuously profitable from day one, even if the margins shrink in the long term.

3. Many SaaS companies generate the majority of their revenue from just one or two key products (SKUs). They often reinvest a significant portion of their profits into research and development (R&D) to replicate their initial success and expand their revenue streams. However, this approach can lead to a cycle of developing new features and products that do not generate the expected revenue, resulting in wasted efforts and resources. In contrast, the storage business offers linear scalability and is a high-intent, "always in demand" industry. This inherent demand helps prevent wasted cycles, allowing us to focus on sustainable growth and long-term profitability.

By integrating SaaS solutions into our business model, we can create a balanced approach that combines the stability and revenue potential of software with the tangible assets of a storage company. This strategy allows us to innovate and grow sustainably, ensuring that we can meet the demands of modern customers while maintaining financial health.
